      The Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship is a competitive grant funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The grant provides a total of \$8,500 to assist students in acquiring foreign language and either area or international studies competencies. I received this grant for the second consecutive year to take an advanced Italian language course through the Umbra Institute. Through this course I reached a CEFR-B2 (Upper-intermediate) fluency level.

## About Me

I'm a post-baccalaureate Astronomy & Physics researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm interested in 
exoplanet formation, detection, and characterization, the application of computational methods to study a variety of astrophysical phenomena, and stellar astronomy.
My work includes variable star analysis using Kepler mission data for the open cluster NGC 6819, using computational methods to 
study of the unusually low density "super-puff" planets, and developing data processing tools and pipelines for these projects. 
I graduated in 2025 with my B.S. in Physics, Astronomy-Physics, and Scandinavian Studies, with Certificates in Italian and European Studies. 

Outside of my research, I enjoy Ultimate Frisbee, playing the Uilleann pipes, and backpacking around the world.
