![Figure](/gallery-figs/ResultWDTripleMassRatios.png)

N-body simulation outcomes of binary-single scatterings involving three white dwarfs, shown with respect to inner and outer mass ratio ($m_3$ is the incident star). Key: IMWD - Intermediate Mass White Dwarf ($0.5-0.85M_{\odot}$), MWD - Massive White Dwarf ($\ge0.85M_{\odot}$), LMWD - Low Mass White Dwarf ($<0.5M_{\odot}$), FRB - Possible FRB progenitor event.
